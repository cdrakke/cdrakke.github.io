[{"content":" Overview # This project is a capstone system developed for the Gensan Youth Orchestra and Choir Corporation (GYOCC), an arts and music organization based in General Santos City. The goal was to digitize their operations by building a centralized web platform for handling ticket sales, event bookings, music lesson scheduling, and report generation.\nThe system is built with Django, PostgreSQL, and deployed via Hostinger VPS. It includes real-time booking, secure payments, two-factor authentication, calendar management, and internal messaging.\nMy Role # As part of a 4-member team, I was primarily responsible for:\nDesigning the lesson scheduling and resource borrowing logic Building the 2FA ticket validation system Developing dynamic reports and CSV analytics exports Handling backend API integration with payment gateways Writing technical documentation and deployment scripts Key Features # ✅ Online Ticketing with secure QR codes and 2FA validation 🎯 Booking System for concerts, private events, and student lessons 📚 Lesson Scheduling by instrument, instructor, and availability 📊 Analytics Dashboard with event stats, attendance, and payment logs 🔐 User Roles \u0026amp; Permissions: Admin, Instructor, Organizer, Member 📦 Resource + Repertoire Management: Borrow instruments, access learning materials 🔔 Notifications \u0026amp; Messaging + optional email subscriptions Technical Stack # Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Figma (design) Backend: Python, Django (w/ Class-Based Views \u0026amp; DRF) Database: PostgreSQL with pgAdmin Deployment: Hostinger VPS (Apache2 + Django) Version Control: GitHub Authentication: JWT + OTP (email/SMS 2FA) Challenges \u0026amp; Solutions # 🛠 Lesson Overlaps\nDeveloped custom scheduling logic to detect \u0026amp; prevent double-booking between lessons and events using Django signals and cron-like schedule validators.\n🔐 Secure Ticket Validation\nBuilt a 2FA ticketing system using OTP verification and QR codes scanned at the venue — integrated with user-specific authentication.\n📈 Real-Time Reports\nImplemented downloadable CSV analytics for bookings, payments, and attendance — filtered by event, month, or date range.\nOutcome # The system was tested by actual GYOCC members and staff through alpha testing.\n✅ Result: High satisfaction for ease of use, booking speed, and accessibility.\n📉 Reduced manual workload for event scheduling by over 80%.\nWhat I Learned # Real-world stakeholder communication with a live organization Working in a full-stack Django architecture under deadlines Handling edge cases in time-sensitive user features like scheduling and payment confirmation Importance of modular backend structure for scaling new features Methodology ℹ️ # We adopted the Inverted Spiral Model as our system development life cycle. This model allowed us to iteratively develop, test, and refine core modules while managing risks at every phase. It emphasized continuous consultation with our capstone adviser and host organization, making it ideal for a project that required real-time feedback, evolving user needs, and phased rollouts like booking, ticketing, and lesson scheduling.\nShowcase 📸 # Homepage # Staff Page # Dashboard # Payment Sample # Payment Success - Maya\u0026rsquo;s End # Payment Sample - Web App\u0026rsquo;s End # Alpha Testing 🧪 # Previous Nextsads We conducted alpha testing with actual members, instructors, and staff of the Gensan Youth Orchestra and Choir Corporation. Testers were invited to register, explore features such as booking, ticketing, and lesson scheduling, and provide structured feedback through evaluation forms. The results showed high user satisfaction, particularly in ease of navigation and reduced booking friction. Their feedback directly informed final adjustments before the system’s completion and presentation.\nCertifications ✔️ # Final Thoughts 💭 # This project was more than just a system build — it was a hands-on experience in real-world software development, from problem analysis to deployment and testing. Working with a live organization like GYOCC taught us the importance of user-centric design, stakeholder collaboration, and agile iteration. The system we delivered not only improved their operations but gave us a deeper understanding of how technology can empower local arts and culture.\n💬 Want to know more about this project?

Rulete # An enthusiastic and self-taught programmer who enjoys building practical tools and contributing to projects that serve both individuals and organizations. I believe in working smart: solving problems through code so that others (and myself) can work less.\n💻 What I Do # Python # Python is my main language. From full-stack web apps to automation bots, I’ve used it to create solutions that save time and solve problems. For web development, I use Django along with libraries like Bootstrap, PayMaya API, and Google Email API. My college capstone is built entirely on this stack.\nC# \u0026amp; Unity # C# became my secondary language thanks to my interest in game development using Unity. I’ve developed simple games to understand how engines work, building a foundation in interactive and real-time programming.\nSelf-Made Tools # In my free time, I enjoy developing personal applications and tools that automates repetitive tasks.\nFor example:\nGLiberator, a Discord bot that automated emoji voting with over 13 customizable commands. Internal automations for image submissions, voting thresholds, and duplicates. Creating things that make life easier — even if it takes effort upfront — is something I genuinely enjoy.\n🧠 Mindset \u0026amp; Motivation # I’m not just a coder — I’m a builder.\nI enjoy turning abstract ideas into real, usable software. I work best when I’m creating something from scratch, whether it’s:\nFixing technical pain points. Improving workflow. Or automating boring tasks. Despite how that sounds, I’m happiest when my work helps someone else do less work.\n🔗 Find Me Online # GitHub: @cdrakke ","date":"June 14, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/me/","section":"Abouts","summary":"👋 Hello, I\u0026rsquo;m Calvin Drakke I.","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"June 14, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/about-me/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"about-me","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"June 14, 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Abouts","summary":"","title":"Abouts","type":"about"},{"content":" History # I was born in South Cotabato, General Santos City.
