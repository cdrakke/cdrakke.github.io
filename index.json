Rulete # An enthusiastic and self-taught programmer who enjoys building practical tools and contributing to projects that serve both individuals and organizations. I believe in working smart: solving problems through code so that others (and myself) can work less.\nðŸ’» What I Do # Python # Python is my main language. From full-stack web apps to automation bots, Iâ€™ve used it to create solutions that save time and solve problems. For web development, I use Django along with libraries like Bootstrap, PayMaya API, and Google Email API. My college capstone is built entirely on this stack.\nC# \u0026amp; Unity # C# became my secondary language thanks to my interest in game development using Unity. Iâ€™ve developed simple games to understand how engines work, building a foundation in interactive and real-time programming.\nSelf-Made Tools # In my free time, I enjoy developing personal applications and tools that automates repetitive tasks.\nFor example:\nGLiberator, a Discord bot that automated emoji voting with over 13 customizable commands. Internal automations for image submissions, voting thresholds, and duplicates. Creating things that make life easier â€” even if it takes effort upfront â€” is something I genuinely enjoy.\nðŸ§  Mindset \u0026amp; Motivation # Iâ€™m not just a coder â€” Iâ€™m a builder.\nI enjoy turning abstract ideas into real, usable software. I work best when Iâ€™m creating something from scratch, whether itâ€™s:\nFixing technical pain points. Improving workflow. Or automating boring tasks. Despite how that sounds, Iâ€™m happiest when my work helps someone else do less work.\nðŸ”— Find Me Online # GitHub: @cdrakke ","date":"14 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/me/","section":"Abouts","summary":"ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I\u0026rsquo;m Calvin Drakke I.","title":"About Me","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"14 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/about-me/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"about-me","type":"series"},{"content":"","date":"14 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"Abouts","summary":"","title":"Abouts","type":"about"},{"content":"","date":"14 June 2025","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Drekyz","summary":"","title":"Drekyz","type":"page"},{"content":" History # I was born in South Cotabato, General Santos City.
